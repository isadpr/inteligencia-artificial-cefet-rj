        This class represents a node in the tree generated when executing the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm.
        Each node corresponds to a game state and contains information about the game,
        the moves available from that state, and the results of simulations from that state.
        The node keeps track of its parent, the move that led to it, the number of visits,
        the number of wins, and the children nodes that can be reached from it.
